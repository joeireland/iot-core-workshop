# AWS IoT Core Workshop

![AWS IoT](images/aws-iot.png)

The following presents a workshop on AWS IoT Core and AWS IoT Greengrass. The workshop is very hands on and makes use of a Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera and Grove Pi+ sensor kit. Below we provide a **[Prerequisites](./Workshop-Prerequisits.md)** section, which is typically completed for you by the workshop organizer before you start. This Prerequisites section describes the hardware used by this workshop, provides links on how to purchase this hardware and finishes with a section describing how to install the operating system and other software packages required by this workshop.

Due to **COVID-19** and popular demand, a virtual version of this workshop is now available. This virtual workshop makes use of a virtual IoT device which simulates the hardware and sensors used by this workshop. Refer to the virtual version of the IoT Core workshop below for details. Please note that a single workshop may be performed where some attendees use physical hardware while others use the virtual IoT device either because they are remote or due to a limited number of available hardware stations.

The **hardware-based workshop** is broken down into 6 parts:


* [Prerequisites](./Workshop-Prerequisits.md)
* [Part 1 - Assemble and Test Raspberry Pi](./Workshop1-GrovePi.md)
* [Part 2 - AWS IoT Device Registration](./Workshop2-DeviceOnboarding.md)
* [Part 3 - AWS IoT Rules](./Workshop3-rules.md)
* [Part 4 - Web-based HMI (Human-Machine Interface)](./Workshop4-HMI.md)
* [Part 5 - Thing Shadows](./Workshop5-thing-shadow.md)
* [Part 6 - Greengrass Machine Learning @ The Edge](./Workshop6-greengrass.md)

The **virtual workshop** is broken down into 5 parts:


* [Part 1 - Virtual IoT Device Simulator](./Workshop1-Virtual-Device.md)
* [Part 2 - AWS IoT Device Registration](./Workshop2-Virtual-DeviceOnboarding.md)
* [Part 3 - AWS IoT Rules](./Workshop3-Virtual-rules.md)
* [Part 4 - Web-based HMI (Human-Machine Interface)](./Workshop4-Virtual-HMI.md)
