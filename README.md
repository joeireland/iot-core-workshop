# AWS IoT Core Workshop

![AWS IoT](images/aws-iot.png)

The following presents a workshop on AWS IoT Core and AWS IoT Greengrass. The workshop is very hands on and makes use of a Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera and Grove Pi+ sensor kit. Below we provide a **[Prerequisits](./Workshop-Prerequisits.md)** section, which is typically completed for you by the workshop organizer before you start. This Prerequisits section describes the hardware used by this workshop, provides links on how to purchase this hardware and finishes with a section describing how to install the operating system and other software packages required by this workshop.
